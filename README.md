# lua_stl
# this project show you how to use lua language only to build a STL container library:
# based on lua-table:
#   TabStack.lua
#   TabQueue.lua
#   TabList.lua
#   TabSet.lua
#   TabMap.lua
#   TabMMap.lua
# based on linklist:
#   Queue.lua
#   List.lua
#   Set.lua
#   Map.lua
#   MMap.lua
#
# basic test is all passed, if you feel it's not safe, please do not use it
# unfortunately, when i finished this project, i found a very good cpp project named swig, 
# swig is so good to handle data convert problems for cpp to lua or cpp to any scripts, 
# so you can use swig to rebuild cpp-stl library, and build the convert API library,
# then you can use very high-performance STL library of lua.
# thank you for noted this project, have a good day.
